		  <p>SIGPwny is a student-run information security club at UIUC.  We
		  host weekly public meetings on low-barrier-of-entry security topics
		  that are focused on collaborative learning and friendly environments.
		  In addition, we coordinate weekly focus groups for more in-depth
		  exploration in topics like embedded hacking, penetration testing, and
		  fuzzing research.</p>

		  <p>We are interested in working with sponsors. Please contact us if you're interested.</p>

		  <p>SIGPwny is spelled SIGPwny, but some alums might remember it as SIGPony. SIGPwny was originally named SIGMil. SIGMil was founded around 2002, and reborn as SIGPwny around 2011.</p>
		  
		  <p>SIGPwny is mentored by <a href="http://klevchen.ece.illinois.edu/">Kirill Levchenko</a> and <a href="http://joshm.web.engr.illinois.edu/">Joshua Mason</a>. We work extensively with Michael Bailey's <a href="https://nsrg.sprai.org/">Network Security Research Group</a>.</p>
