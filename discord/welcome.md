Hi! Welcome to SIGPwny. We're a security club focused on being **friendly** and **learning together**.

We put a lot of effort into our **weekly meetings**, which are designed to be drop-in. There's a 15 minute presentation, followed by 45 minutes of practicing whatever the presentation was about, with help from knowledgable SIGPwny members! If you're interested in teaching/designing a meeting, please reach out! It's great practice and something you can put on your resume. Around half of our meetings last year were taught by underclassmen.

We also **play CTF** from time to time. It hasn't been our highest priority in the past, since we were focusing on building a good core club. We're interested in doing more now!

We have **research opportunities** for research credit for freshmen and sophomores. You (learn to) make CTF challenges in exchange for one credit hour. It's good for your GPA and helps you learn about the club!

We have a **calendar**: <https://sigpwny.com/calendar>. You can add it to your Google Calendar and it'll update with future meetings.

There is a **UIUC Discord role** which gives you access to the rest of the channels. You can sign up for it here: <https://sigpwny.com/auth> (or ask for it)

This server is very high volume, as many Discord servers are. You might consider muting channels that don't interest you.

Since this is an in-person club, please consider setting a nickname that reflects your "real" (preferred) name. It helps everyone know who you are when chatting c:
